# racket_GUIGame
We were tasked with creating a GUI game that emulated the classic 'Galaga'.

left arrow   -  Moves the character ship to the left.
right arrow  -  Moves the character ship to the right.
x            -  Fires missles.

Although the game works, there are bugs. If any other key is pressed other than the left arrow, right arrow or 'x' key the program will crash.
